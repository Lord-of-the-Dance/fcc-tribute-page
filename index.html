                    “For there is but one essential justice which cements society, and one law which establishes this justice. This law is right reason, which is the true rule of all commandments and prohibitions. Whoever neglects this law, whether written or unwritten, is necessarily unjust and wicked.”
                    ― Marcus Tullius Cicero, On the Laws

                    <li><span class="year-text">87 BC</span> - Studied Philosophy under Philo of Larissa, the head of the Platonic Academy</li>

                    <li><span class="year-text">63 BC</span> - After ascending the Cursus Honorum, is elected Consul. During this time, he would famously thwart the Cataline Conspiracy, and put all conspirators to death, controversally without trial</li>
                    <li><span class="year-text">60 BC</span> - Invited by Julius Caesar to be the fourth member of what would become the first Triumvirate and refused, believing correctly that it would undermine the Republic</li>
                    <li><span class="year-text">58 BC</span> - Clodius, a newly elected Tribune of the Plebs, used Triumvirate backing to exile Cicero from Rome. Cicero left for Thessalonica, during which time his house was demolished and his reputation in shambles</li>

                    <li><span class="year-text">43 BC</span> - Murdered under the orders of the Second Triumvirate, despite arguments from Octavian.
